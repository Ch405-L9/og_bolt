+
+1. **Project Initialization & Review**  
+   - Analyze the full directory structure and file contents.
+   - Identify all Kotlin/Java source files relevant to: MainActivity, Parsers, Readers, Document handling, PDF/TXT/EPUB processing.
+   - Review build files: app/build.gradle*, build.gradle*, settings.gradle* to understand dependencies.
+   - Check AndroidManifest.xml for permissions, activities, and Firebase integration.
+   - Map the app architecture and highlight any potential structural issues.
+
+2. **Parsing Verification & Debug**  
+   - Confirm that PDF, TXT, and EPUB parsing pipelines function as expected.
+   - Flag any parsing errors, threading issues, or performance bottlenecks.
+   - Ensure debug tools or placeholders (e.g., Dodgeable version) are integrated correctly.
+
+3. **Testing & Validation**  
+   - Run any existing tests or suggest tests for parsing, file reading, and main activity flows.
+   - Confirm that the APK can build successfully with minimal warnings or errors.
+   - Validate compatibility with the Android SDK versions defined in the build files.
+
+4. **Version Control & Git Integration**  
+   - Stage, commit, and push updates to the `og_bolt` repository.

+   - Maintain a clean commit history; ensure no unnecessary files are added.  
+   - Confirm the remote branch `main` is properly tracking the GitHub repo.
+
+5. **Workflow Optimization**  
+   - Suggest improvements or fixes only if they **increase stability, parsing accuracy, or maintainability by at least 10%**, without introducing major risks.
+   - Provide a concise report of what was verified, fixed, or flagged for attention.
+
+6. **Communication & Queries**  
+   - If you encounter ambiguities in the code or missing information, generate **clear questions** before attempting modifications.
+   - Do **not** make assumptions about missing files; request them explicitly.
+
+7. **Execution Instructions**  
+   - Start by scanning the repo: list all relevant files.  
+   - Audit parsing pipelines (PDF/TXT/EPUB).  
+   - Perform debug validation.  
+   - Stage and commit verified changes.  
+   - Push updates to GitHub `main`.

+You are performing a comprehensive audit and review of the Android/Kotlin project in the repository: `badgr_bolt_ropr`. The repository now contains the full Kotlin/Android source, Gradle build files, resources, and previous parsing modules.
+
+Your objectives:
+
+1. **Review all files**
+   - Scan the entire project directory, including:
+     - `ReaderRSVP` sources (Kotlin/Java)
+     - `app/build.gradle`, `build.gradle`, `settings.gradle`
+     - `lib/parsers`, `lib/rsvp-engine.ts`, `types/book.ts`
+     - Resources (`res/`), manifests, and TRASH backups
+
+2. **Check parsing pipelines**
+   - Identify and review PDF, TXT, EPUB parsing logic.
+   - Ensure files are read, processed, and returned correctly.
+   - Detect any known edge cases, errors, or potential exceptions in parsing.
+
+3. **Audit threading & APK structure**
+   - Examine concurrency or multithreading implementations.
+   - Check for proper usage of background threads, async tasks, and potential race conditions.
+   - Verify APK build structure aligns with Gradle configurations.
+
+4. **Suggest improvements**
+   - Recommend fixes for parsing errors, threading issues, or APK misconfigurations.
+   - Highlight any missing files, dependencies, or required updates.
+   - Suggest optimizations that will maintain or improve build stability.
+
+5. **Pushing & Git**
+   - After verification, ensure all changes are safe for Git commits.
+   - No need to create new commits; this is a review and audit step only.
+
+6. **Instructions**
+   - Operate as if you have full access to the repository.
+   - Provide clear, actionable feedback.
+   - Use technical detail appropriate for Kotlin/Android development.
+
+**Goal:** Prepare this project for a clean build, stable parsing functionality, and complete readiness for GitHub versioning, CI/CD, and further development.  
+
+Start by giving a **file-by-file audit summary**, flagging any issues, and ending with recommended next steps before we proceed to further development or deployment.

+You are performing a **full audit** of the Android/React Native hybrid project located in:
+
+/home/t0n34781/Manus API/badgr_bolt_ropr
+
+Include all files, especially the `ReaderRSVP_flat` directory that contains the original Kotlin/Android sources, TypeScript, Gradle files, and resources. Treat them as part of the same project.
+
+Your objectives:
+
+1. **Parsing Pipeline Audit**
+   - Review PDF, TXT, EPUB parsing logic.
+   - Check lib/parsers/index.ts, lib/rsvp-engine.ts, types/book.ts.
+   - Identify potential issues with async handling, threading, or file encoding.
+   - Suggest fixes for performance, stability, or API compatibility.
+
+2. **Android/Kotlin Layer Review**
+   - Audit APK project structure, Gradle files (build.gradle, settings.gradle, app/build.gradle or .kts), and AndroidManifest.xml.
+   - Verify Kotlin/Java sources in `ReaderRSVP_flat` for MainActivity, parsers, readers, and any core classes.
+   - Detect threading issues, improper context handling, or misconfigured resources.
+
+3. **React Native / TypeScript Layer Review**
+   - Review all `.tsx` and `.ts` files in app/ and lib/ directories.
+   - Check navigation, state management, hooks, and integration with native modules.
+
+4. **Cross-Layer Integration**
+   - Check for correct interaction between TypeScript logic and native Kotlin layer.
+   - Detect potential parsing bottlenecks or mismatches between RN and native parsing.
+
+5. **Recommendations**
+   - List **critical issues** first (blocking or crash-prone).
+   - Suggest **minor improvements** second (performance, maintainability).
+   - Include **retrofitting or patch suggestions** for missing UTF-8 handling, threading safety, or Gradle misconfigurations.
+   - Provide **any CLI/test scripts or commands** needed to verify fixes before committing or pushing.
+
+6. **Output Format**
+   - Structured: Critical Issues, Minor Improvements, Suggested Fixes.
+   - Include file paths relative to `badgr_bolt_ropr` for every finding.
+   - Be concise but detailed enough for direct implementation.
+
+**Note:** Assume all files in `ReaderRSVP_flat` are part of the main project for audit purposes. Prioritize safety (no destructive actions) and clarity.
+
+---
+
+Run the audit **as if you are a senior Android + React Native engineer** tasked with ensuring the project is production-ready and fully stable before any further Git commits or pushes. Include any missing or unsafe patterns you notice.

+You are auditing the complete Android + React Native hybrid project in this GitHub repository:
+
+https://github.com/Ch405-L9/og_bolt
+
+Specifically, include and analyze all files in the `ReaderRSVP_flat` directory and the rest of the project. Do not skip anything relevant.
+
+Your objectives:
+
+1. **Project Structure Audit**
+   - List all modules and subdirectories.
+   - Identify Android native code (Kotlin/Java) in `ReaderRSVP_flat`.
+   - Identify React Native / TypeScript code in the main project.
+   - Verify Gradle files, manifest, and resource structure.
+
+2. **Parsing Pipeline Logic**
+   - Examine the file parsing logic for PDF/TXT/EPUB.
+   - Identify potential issues with asynchronous handling, errors, and edge cases.
+   - Suggest improvements for reliability and performance.
+
+3. **Android/Kotlin Layer Validation**
+   - Analyze AndroidMainfest, Gradle configurations, and build settings.
+   - Evaluate threading, lifecycle management, and concurrency safety.
+   - Report missing permissions, misconfigurations, or integration errors.
+
+4. **Integration Walk‑Through**
+   - Describe how React Native and native Android parts interact.
+   - Identify any breaking points in the bridge between JavaScript and native code.
+
+5. **Recommendations**
+   - Provide a concise list of critical, high‑impact fixes.
+   - Provide a second list of minor or optional improvements.
+   - Suggest test cases or scripts to verify fixes.
+
+Output format:
+
+Critical Issues:
+
+...
+...
+Minor Issues:
+
+...
+...
+Fix Suggestions:
+
+...
+...
+
+
+Refer to all relevant files by relative path in your response.  
+Work with the assumption that you can fetch and read any file in the repo, including those in `ReaderRSVP_flat`.
