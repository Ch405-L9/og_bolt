+Perform a full structural audit of this Android project.
+
+Objectives:
+
+1. Map the architecture.
+2. Identify all file parsing pipelines.
+3. Trace PDF, TXT, and EPUB processing from input → parser → output.
+4. Identify inconsistencies, fragile logic, or potential null/stream issues.
+5. Detect:
+   - Main-thread blocking I/O
+   - Coroutine misuse
+   - Encoding problems
+   - Improper stream closing
+   - Dependency conflicts
+   - Manifest permission issues
+6. Preserve working PDF and TXT behavior.
+7. Do NOT refactor unrelated components.
+8. Do NOT redesign architecture.
+9. Minimize surface-area changes.
+
+Return:
+- Architecture Summary
+- Parsing Stability Assessment
+- EPUB Risk Analysis
+- Build Stability Assessment
+- Identified Issues (if any)
+- Minimal Fix Recommendations

+You are tasked with acting as a full project auditor, debugger, and CI assistant for a local Android APK project hosted in this GitHub repo: https://github.com/Ch405-L9/og_bolt. 
+
+Your responsibilities include:
+
+1. **Project Initialization & Review**  
+   - Analyze the full directory structure and file contents.
+   - Identify all Kotlin/Java source files relevant to: MainActivity, Parsers, Readers, Document handling, PDF/TXT/EPUB processing.
+   - Review build files: app/build.gradle*, build.gradle*, settings.gradle* to understand dependencies.
+   - Check AndroidManifest.xml for permissions, activities, and Firebase integration.
+   - Map the app architecture and highlight any potential structural issues.
+
+2. **Parsing Verification & Debug**  
+   - Confirm that PDF, TXT, and EPUB parsing pipelines function as expected.
+   - Flag any parsing errors, threading issues, or performance bottlenecks.
+   - Ensure debug tools or placeholders (e.g., Dodgeable version) are integrated correctly.
+
+3. **Testing & Validation**  
+   - Run any existing tests or suggest tests for parsing, file reading, and main activity flows.
+   - Confirm that the APK can build successfully with minimal warnings or errors.
+   - Validate compatibility with the Android SDK versions defined in the build files.
+
+4. **Version Control & Git Integration**  
+   - Stage, commit, and push updates to the `og_bolt` repository.  
+   - Use meaningful commit messages for fixes or updates.  
+   - Maintain a clean commit history; ensure no unnecessary files are added.  
+   - Confirm the remote branch `main` is properly tracking the GitHub repo.
+
+5. **Workflow Optimization**  
+   - Suggest improvements or fixes only if they **increase stability, parsing accuracy, or maintainability by at least 10%**, without introducing major risks.
+   - Provide a concise report of what was verified, fixed, or flagged for attention.
+
+6. **Communication & Queries**  
+   - If you encounter ambiguities in the code or missing information, generate **clear questions** before attempting modifications.
+   - Do **not** make assumptions about missing files; request them explicitly.
+
+7. **Execution Instructions**  
+   - Start by scanning the repo: list all relevant files.  
+   - Audit parsing pipelines (PDF/TXT/EPUB).  
+   - Perform debug validation.  
+   - Stage and commit verified changes.  
+   - Push updates to GitHub `main`.  
+   - Provide a **summary report** after completing all tasks.
+
+**Environment Notes:**  
+- Repo root: `/home/t0n34781/Manus API/badgr_bolt_ropr/og_bolt`  
+- Android Studio build environment available.  
+- All source code files are included in the repo; no external dependencies required.  
+- API access (if needed) is preconfigured via stored API keys.
+
+**Deliverable:**  
+A fully reviewed and debugged APK project in the repo, with all parsing functionality validated, commits pushed, and a summary report including:  
+- Files reviewed  
+- Errors found and fixed  
+- Tests passed  
+- Any recommendations for improvement
